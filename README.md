# fork-and-knife

JavaScript application to search recipes and create shopping list.

The initial commit with templates, some code and images are copied from <https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course>. The original version used a deprecated API, this application uses a new API and is a way to practice JavaScript ES6+, npm, webpack, API, etc.
