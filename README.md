# fork-and-knife

JavaScript application to search recipes and create shopping list.

The initial commit with templates, some code and images are copied from <https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course>. The original version used a deprecated API, this application uses a new API and is a way to practice JavaScript ES6+, npm, webpack, API, etc.

## API

- Sign up API in <https://spoonacular.com/food-api>

```js
export const apiKey = 'api key';
```
